Adapted Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================
Yannis Kassios
==================================================================

The data set is an adaptation of the one given in [1]

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

Two data sets are provided, stored in files "allData.csv" and "meansBySubjectActivity.csv".


Data Set allData.csv
====================

For each observation is provided:
---------------------------------

Subject: An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
Activity: One of the six activities of the experiment.  These are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING.
A 66-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.  For more details, see "features_info.txt".  Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].


Data Set meansBySubjectActivity.csv
===================================

For each observation is provided:
---------------------------------

Subject: An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
Activity: One of the six activities of the experiment.  These are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING.
Sixty-six (66) feature values with the means of all observations of the corresponding features in data set "allData.csv" per subject and activity. 


The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'CodeBook.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'README.md'

- 'allData.csv': First Data Set

- 'meansBySubjectActivity.csv': Second Data Set

- 'run_analysis.R': R script to compile the two data sets from [1]
